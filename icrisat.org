* Introduction
  Here we'll explore actual consumption decisions made by some very
  poor households drawn from a set of villages in South India studied
  by the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid
  Tropics (ICRISAT) starting in the mid-seventies, and continuing
  (irregularly) up to 2004.  Data are drawn from a sample of
  households in each of six different villages.

* Consumption Expenditures from Schedule L
   We can collect detailed consumption expenditure items by examining
   Schedule L, with its system of double-accounting.  Here the account
   code for food is 71 ("including milk, sweets and spices"), and the
   account code for "Narcotics, tea, coffee, tobacco, pan, alcoholic
   beverages" is 72.  Other sorts of expenditures related to
   consumption are in accounts 71--79, as follows:

item codes.

* Food Conversion (to nutrients)
  Alessandro Tarozzi provides a mapping from foods reported in the
  68th round of the NSS data into nutritional outcomes, using
  nutritive values from cite:gopalan-etal80.  Identifying foods
  consumed in the ICRISAT data which correspond to foods in the NSS
  data is mostly straight-forward.
